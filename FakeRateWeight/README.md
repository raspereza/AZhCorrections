The fake rate root file contains sevarel histograms plotting the fake rate as a function of lepton pT:

In the jet to electron/muon fake rate root files

"PrefitFR_barrel" and "PrefitFR_endcap" are the fake rates obtained by simple prompt subtraction without maximum likelyhood fitting.
"PostfitFR_barrel" and "PostfitFR_endcap" are the fake rates obtained by performing maximum likelyhood fitting and then subtracting data with prompt.
"JetToEle(Mu)Pre(Post)fit" are the corresponding 2D histogram combined both barrel and endcap regions.

The fake rates as function could aslo be fitting by a numerical polynomial fit. And the systematics could be also determined from the fit.
"POL2FitFR_Central_Barrel(Endcap)" returns the value of the fit, while "POL2FitFR_Uncert68(95)_Barrel" returns the 1(2) sigma error.
